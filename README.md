Building on the material covered by *Statistics 1 - Introduction probability and hypothesis testing*, this course will go deeper in the topic of hypothesis testing.
The course is organized in three chapters, covering the following topics. All will be followed by a practical session, both in python and R.

# Roadmap of the course

## Chapter 1. Parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.

- Parameter estimation. Recap hypothesis testing.
- Comparing mean values. The t-test.
- Comparing variances. The F-test.

## Chapter 2. ANOVA. Comparing distributions and multiple groups.

- Recap z and t scores. The z distribution and student's t distribution.
- Comparing means / variances of more than two groups. ANOVA.
- Comparing distributions. The chi2 test.

## Chapter 3. Multiple hypothesis correction.

- P-values and significance.
- Error types in hypothesis testing. 
- Adjusted p-values. Bonferroni and BH coffection.

## Setup

We will be working with jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to access jupyter is via the Anaconda platform.
Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the workshop.
NB no knowledge of programming is required for this workshop.


## Getting Started

1. Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

2. Open JupyterLab (within Anaconda) and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .ipynb examples.

3. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/further_hypothesis_testing/master?urlpath=lab)
