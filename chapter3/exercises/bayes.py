# Define hypotheses
# H1: "The die is biased"
# H2: "The die is fair"
# E: "I rolled a 6"

# Priors
P_H1 = 0.5  # Prior probability of rolling a biased die
P_H2 = 0.5  # Prior probability of rolling a fair die

# Likelihoods
P_E_given_H1 = 1/2 # P(E | H1): Probability of rolling a 6 given the die is biased
P_E_given_H2 = 1/6 # P(E | H2): Probability of rolling a 6 given the die is fair

# Compute marginal probability P(E):
# P(E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) + P(E | H2) * P(H2)
P_E = P_E_given_H1 * P_H1 + P_E_given_H2 * P_H2

# Compute posterior probabilities using Bayes' rule
# P(H1 | E) = P(E | H1) * P(H1) / P(E)
P_H1_given_E = (P_E_given_H1 * P_H1) / P_E

# P(H2 | E) = P(E | H2) * P(H2) / P(E)
P_H2_given_E = (P_E_given_H2 * P_H2) / P_E

# Print the results

# Probability of not having the disease

# Total probability of testing positive (P(Positive Test))
